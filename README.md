# Hello! Welcome to my basic calculator

My name is Carolina and I made this for an inclass assignment using only javascript. It is a basic calculator only accepting inputs of ( `\`, `*`, `/`, `+` or `-`) And two values only (maxiumum of 3) using process.agv.

## how to use

First you will have to clone the repository or download it.

to clone open your terminal or git bash, cd into the desired document you want to hold it.
Then copy and paste what I have below.

```
git clone https://github.com/Felisong/cpnt262-basic-calculator
```

if you download it just press on the green <> Code button and click download from the dropdown. Download into your desired path.

After you have the form

Open the terminal and type node calculator.js
Then the next three inputs need to be what you wish to calculate.

```
node calculator.js number1 "('*', '/', '+' or '-')" number2
```

in example what you would type for 20 / 5 is

```
node calculator.js 20 "/" 5
```

then it should provide the answer (output) of
4

## final thoughts as a project

TBA but getting started was really hard but as soon as I figured out what process.argv was I had an idea on how to implement and starting thinking from there.
